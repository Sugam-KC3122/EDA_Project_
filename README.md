# Automobile Sales Data Visualization  

## 📌 Project Overview 
The objective is to analyze **automobile sales trends** and understand how factors such as **time and advertising expenditure** influence sales performance.

The analysis is performed using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook**, with visualizations created using popular data analysis libraries.

- Visualize sales trends using line charts
- Study the relationship between **advertising expenditure** and **automobile sales**
- Draw insights from visual data representations

---

## 📊 Tasks Covered
### Task 1.1
- Develop a **line chart** using Pandas
- Show how **average automobile sales fluctuate over the years**

### Task 1.2
- Analyze trends in **advertising expenditure**
- Study correlation between advertising and automobile sales
- Provide **graph-based inference**
